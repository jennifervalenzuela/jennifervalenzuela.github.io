View my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dGnEyww8Jf2GfFzap0LkjCyaIRGsCMblpnX_i5tkRvg/edit?usp=sharing).

I am a graduate student in the Latin American and Iberian Studies Master’s program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am a teaching assistant for the undergraduate, lower-division course titled Introduction to Latin American and Iberian Studies. I was previously a teaching assistant for HIST 8B in the History Department, Latin American History: Independence and the National Period. I also participated in the CITRAL Community of Practice for Graduate Students: Course Design for Equity in their two-quarter program during the 2023-2024 academic school year, where I honed my skills integrating ideals of anti-racism and equity into the classroom. I was also part of the UCSB Engaging Humanities Foundational Course Redesign Initiative for HIST 8B with a professor and a team of graduate student assistants to create engaging pedagogical materials and enhance student participation to align with course objectives.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the University of California, Riverside, with a minor in Latin American Studies. I was involved in UCR’s student organization, Providing Opportunities, Dreams, and Education in Riverside (PODER), leading its social media account and providing resources in an ever-changing political and social environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, I had the opportunity to design, plan, and teach my own undergraduate course, which fellow students could take for course credit, called R’Courses.

My teaching philosophy focuses on creating a welcoming and comfortable environment where students feel confident sharing their ideas and engaging in meaningful discussions. I am deeply committed to fostering critical engagement with course readings while encouraging students to draw connections to real-world problems. My previous experience as a TA for the History department for the course HIST 8B: Latin American History: Independence and the National Period, leading discussion sections incorporating democratic pedagogy, has reinforced my commitment to inclusive education. These experiences have helped facilitate student discussions and create an interactive learning environment that keeps students engaged and excited about the subject. As a TA, I am dedicated to developing my teaching skills and creating an inclusive and supportive classroom environment to support students' academic journeys, ensuring that every student feels valued and included. 

I am fluent in Spanish reading and writing and a novice American Sign Language (ASL) signer. I also have experience translating documents from Spanish to English and vice versa, stemming from my experience with the Course Redesign Initiative from HIST 8B.
