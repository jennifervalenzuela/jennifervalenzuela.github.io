My name is Jennifer Valenzuela, and I am a Master’s student in the Latin American and Iberian Studies program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My educational journey started at the University of California, Riverside, where I had the opportunity to create an R’course on Peru’s Internal Armed Conflict (1980 to 2000). R’courses are student-initiated courses based on original ideas that aim to teach undergraduates how to implement democratic pedagogy, a theory that everyone in the classroom is equal. This unique project and my family’s experience living through the conflict inspired me to pursue research. My interests have culminated in my Master’s thesis, tentatively titled *Memory Struggles in Peru: The Attacks of Memorial Places in Lima and Ayacucho*, which aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges surrounding the memory of the conflict.

My research analyzes the physical and verbal attacks spanning the years 2007 to 2025 surrounding memory places and the members and representatives of the Place of Memory Tolerance and Social Inclusion (LUM), the monument The Eye that Cries, as well as the Museum of Memory created by the National Association of Relatives of Kidnapped, Detained and Disappeared of Peru (ANFASEP), the first museum of its kind in Peru. I aim to provide insight into how the attacks against these memory places reflect ultra-right conservative groups and organizations’ attempts to reshape or silence narratives about the Internal Armed Conflict that challenge state crimes, expose military abuses, or threaten the reputation of politicians who were in power during the period of violence. It also explores the implications for the future of memorial sites that prioritize the experiences of victims and their testimonies, focusing on the mission to preserve truth and justice in Peru.

Outside academic commitments, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and film photography. My outdoor hobbies include running, pickleball, and scenic walks to shoot some film.
